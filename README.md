# fabuladegoblins-sheets

This repository was designed as a foundation of Sheet adaptations for the `Fabula de Goblins` system.
The primary use for the repository is to keep store a versioned edition of the Sheets made initially for `Roll20` system.

The idea use this repository as a Center entrypoint for any kind of port of the `Fabula de Goblins` sheet or any subject related to the `Fabula de Goblins` Player Sheet.
